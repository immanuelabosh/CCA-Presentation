---

Next generation of facilities coming online

Alibaba, Amazon, JD

---

### Micron

- Manufacturer of DRAM & NAND
- World leader in automated manufacturing

---

### IoT in factories

- Prevent downtime
- Better QA
- Reduce reliance on humans

---

Automated production lines produce huge amounts of data

### Power them with ML & AI

---

### Edge compute

Instead of streaming data, process it at or near the source

---

## Delivery Logistics

---

Disruption of traditional delivery in Australia

Instacart, Amazon Fresh/Prime, Shipt, Google Express

Cheap/free same day delivery

---

Increased conveniance → Increased demand

---

Delivery logistics will only get more efficient

---

Real time monitoring of traffic conditions + ML powered real-time optimisation of delivery routes

---

Blockchain based automated inventory tracking + IoT

- GPS trackers
- Thermometers
- RFID tags

---

### Automate paperwork with smart contracts

---

Drones and self driving cars are an unlikely possibility within 5 years

---

## Sales

---

## We are in a time of unprecedented, direct access to consumers

- Ads blocked by default on modern browsers and OSes
- Ad fraud is increasingly complex
- ROI not as good as advertisers claim

---

### AR & VR experiences

- Consumer technology now capable of AR experiences
  - 19 Crimes Wine
- Novel and interesting

---

### Big Data

Predict consumer trends with Big Data and get ahead of the curve
